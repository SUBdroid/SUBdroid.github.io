# What I primarily do?

Doing my PhD research at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University in Prague.
I use Linux and prefer Python for my work. Although given enough time, I would love to rewrite everything in C.

## Primary Research Interests
* Multimodality: How to make AI systems better and handling data from different modalities (text+image,text+audio etc.).
* Machine Translation: How to make AI translation systems better and thus how make AI better with handling langauges?
* Meaning Representations: How do AI systems make sense of the world? How and where are meanings represented by AI systems (and humans)?
* Cognitive Linguistics and Psycholinguistics: How do 'we' (humans) process language and how do we formally understand that process?
* Linguistic structures in neural networks: Do artificial neural networks understand language like any linguist does? How does AI represent languages in formal way?

## Other interests
* I love listening to music (will link my Spotify playlist here later)
* I love making music (I said I love it...not that I make any good music!)
* I love reading (currently I am reading "Decoding Reality" by Vlatko Vedral)
* I love movies (my current favorite is 'Ex Machina')
* I love travelling (and thus taking really bad photos)

# What I would like to do
* Finish my PhD 
* Explore multimodality from a perspective of robotics
* Gain some more experience with EEG, fMRI and MEG
